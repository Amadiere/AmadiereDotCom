This is a simple repository for me to keep control of my website within. The website isn't meant as an a full blogging platform,
and is just a way for me to have more control over the appearance of my content, and any clientside code that I write. More than
Wordpress seems to let me easily.

I've chosen the MIT License. While there isn't much reason to copy the code, people are welcome to explore and steal what is of use,
as long as I get a kick-back :)
