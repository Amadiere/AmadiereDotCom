                            years early at Tameside Council. Built in two stages to ensure it met a legal deadline imposed, the system was rolled out on
                            time to positive reception. Built using C#, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework 4 (Code First) with heavy use of JQuery to ease
                            user input. The system had to take into account the variety of working patterns / arrangements within the Council, including
                            facilitating automatic enforced restrictions where appropriate.

                            <strong>Phonebook / Profile System</strong>: Integrating with the previous two systems, the Phone Book using Active Directory as it's
                            primary data store (but generating a cache for performance purposes). It allowed staff to update most of their details and
                            add photographs to their account, which were reflected then in Outlook and Lync for them.
