        <strong>I enjoy coding</strong>. From the large system architecture & planning, all the way down to problem solving. There is something about the Eureka moment that
        is intoxicating. I feel with programming, I'll never stop learning, as there is always an area I know nothing about. That's what makes it so special!
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a tech and team lead with an informal approach to management and with a desire to be one of the team, while still being the buck-stops-here and capable of offering
        technical direction where needed.

    I'm a big fan of board & card games. I love playing social deduction games such as <strong>One Night Werewolf</strong>, <strong>Mafia De Cuba</strong> and 
    <strong>Secret Hitler</strong>. As well as the more in-depth, strategy-heavy ones such as <strong>Game Of Thrones</strong>, <strong>Alchemist</strong> and 
    <strong>Through The Ages: Civilization</strong>.

<div class="secondary-section">
    As also mentioned, when not at work drinking coffee and fruit "teas", I love Whisky.
    I love a wide range of whisky, from the smooth Irish like Jamesons - to the heavy punch-you-in-the-face scotches like Ardbeg, Lagavulin and Laphroig.
